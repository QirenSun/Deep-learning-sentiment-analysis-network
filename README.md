Sentiment Classification projects

Abstraction:
  This project aims to classify the reviews in POSITIVE & NEGATIVE labels. In this project, we built the 3-layer Neural Network and divided the data into training data and testing data. We also explored how to get better weight initialization and found a way to reduce neural noise. Because network inefficiencies is a essential problem, the project will create a method to improve the program's performance.
